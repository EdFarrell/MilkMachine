{"name":"MilkMachine","tagline":"QGIS Python Plugin for creating KML from GPS data","body":"### Welcome to the MilkMachine Project Page!\r\nMilkMachine is a QGIS Python Plugin for creating KML (keyhole markup language) files from GPS data. The code and components developed to support the 250 Miles Crossing Philadelphia project http://www.250miles.net/. MilkMachine will accept raw gps data in .csv format and allows for creation of KML tours, placemarks, models, audio attachment, spatial smoothing/filtering, and time editing. Once editing is complete, files can be exported to .kml or .kmz. An intermediate shapefile (.shp) is produced that will store the coded attribute information. No cow's milk (or milk of any kind) is produced.\r\n\r\n### Authors, Contributors, Support\r\n- The code was developed by Ed Farrell (@EdFarrell) & Sean McGinnis (@SeanKMcGinnis), and is maintained by Ed. \r\n- MilkMachine was developed to support the 250 Miles Crossing Philadelphia Project (http://www.250miles.net/), featuring digital artists Esther Polak and Ivar van Bekkum (http://www.polakvanbekkum.com/).\r\n- Support for the project came from these sources:\r\n..* University City Science Center\r\n..* Wexford Science + Technology\r\n..* Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority \r\n..* Drexel University","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
