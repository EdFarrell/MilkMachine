{"name":"MilkMachine","tagline":"QGIS Python Plugin for creating KML from GPS data","body":"# Welcome to the MilkMachine Project Page!\r\nMilkMachine is a QGIS Python Plugin for creating KML (keyhole markup language) files from GPS data. The code and components developed to support the 250 Miles Crossing Philadelphia project http://www.250miles.net/. MilkMachine will accept raw gps data in .csv format and allows for creation of KML tours, placemarks, models, audio attachment, spatial smoothing/filtering, and time editing. Once editing is complete, files can be exported to .kml or .kmz. An intermediate shapefile (.shp) is produced that will store the coded attribute information. No cow's milk (or milk of any kind) is produced.\r\n\r\n# Page Contents\r\n- [Quick-Start](#quick-start)\r\n- [Examples](#examples)\r\n  * [Input File Format](#input-file-format)\r\n  * [Example 1: Create a .kml file with placemarks](#example-1-create-a-kml-file-with-placemarks)\r\n  * [Example 2: Create a .kml tour](#example-2-create-a-kml-tour)\r\n  * [Example 3: Sync an audio file to your tour](#example-3-sync-an-audio-file-to-your-tour)\r\n- [Roadmap](#roadmap)\r\n- [Authors, Contributors, Support](#authors-contributors-support)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Quick Start\r\n\r\n- QGIS (2.4 or above) (required)\r\n- Python SciPy (required)\r\n- Google Earth (optional, but necessary to view .kml)\r\n- VLC Media Player (optional, but necessary of syncing audio files)\r\n\r\nFor full installation instructions see https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine. The basic install sequence is that you have QGIS 2.4 (or above) installed (Windows, Mac, Linux). Mac and Linux ship with Python, the Windows version of QGIS will bring along it's own version of Python. Make sure that SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/install.html) is installed. On Linux, just run this\r\n\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install python-scipy\r\n\r\nOn Windows you can use pip\r\n\r\n    pip install scipy\r\n\r\nNow that your dependencies are complete, install MilkMachine into the ~/python/plugins directory for QGIS, if you are grabbing the source from GitHub. If the install worked, you should see the MilkMachine icon in your QGIS toolbar ![MM Icon](https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine/blob/master/src/MilkMachine/icon.png?raw=true). Google Earth is compatible on PC, Mac, & Linux (http://www.google.com/earth/), and so is VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\n## Input File Format\r\n\r\nBefore you get started with using MilkMachine, you have to have some GPS data! To use MilkMachine, those data must be stored in a comma separated file (*.csv) and have 5 columns with sequential GPS locations. The columns that must be present (you can have more than these) are; \r\n\r\n- **date**: Date of the location. Can be in these formats; MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD\r\n- **time**: Time of the location. Must be HH:MM:SS, or HH:MM:SS.mmmmmm. mmmmmm is microseconds. See the Python datetime library for full spec (https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html)\r\n- **x**: Longitude. numeric, geographic coordinates (WGS84)\r\n- **y**: Latitude. numeric, geographic coordinates (WGS84)\r\n- **altitude**: Elevation in reference to sea level (could also be to \"sea floor\"). numeric, meters preferred.\r\n\r\n## Example 1: Create a .kml file with placemarks\r\n\r\n![Figure 1](https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine/blob/master/dist/images/example1_import.PNG?raw=true)  \r\n_**Figure 1.** MilkMachine import raw file. The around the block file can be found here_ https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine/tree/master/sampledata/aroundtheblock  \r\n\r\n![Figure 2](https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine/blob/master/dist/images/example1_import.PNG?raw=true)  \r\n_**Figure 2.** MilkMachine import layer drawn on map canvas_\r\n\r\n1. Import a raw .csv GPS file by clicking the \"Import GPS\" button (Figure 1) and browsing to your csv file. The file must be formatted properly (see above) and have valid data in each of the rows. Once the file path appears in MilkMachine, click the \"Draw Track\" button. This will convert the .csv file to an ESRI Shapefile and the Shapefile will be added to the table of contents and the map canvas (Figure 2). The Shapefile is written to the same directory of your .csv file, and named the same. Also, many columns are added to the Shapefile, which will hold the .kml tag value pairs. Now your ready to edit!\r\n2. Open up a QGIS edit session on the **aroundtheblock** layer.\r\n3. Select all of the features in the **aroundtheblock** layer, and make sure that the layer is selected in the table of content. Only features that are selected will be changed by MilkMachine.\r\n4. Navigate to the \"Placemarks\" tab. The **aroundtheblock** layer should be in the text box. Click the \"Edit Points\" checkbox (Figure 3). Now you are ready create your placemarks!\r\n5. The \"Icon Style\" options control how the placemark will look. Here, I chose to color my placemark blue. The default placemark is the pushpin, but you can link to any icon. Just add the full URL to the \"icon\" option. You can also control how the label will look by using the \"Label Style\" options. Here, I took the defaults so it the labels will appear white. If you don't want labels at all, just change the scale value to 0. All of these options are taken directly from the the KML elements reference. You can hover over the options in MilkMachine to get an idea of what the field does, or you can go directly to the API reference pages (https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference).\r\n6. Navigate over to the \"Export and Details\" tab in MilkMachine. Click the \"Export Track\" button (Figure 4) and save as **\"aroundtheblock_basicplacemark.kml\"** in a directory of your choice.\r\n\r\n![Figure 3](https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine/blob/master/dist/images/example1_placemark.PNG?raw=true)  \r\n_**Figure 3.** Create placemarks for all of the selected features_  \r\n\r\n![Figure 4](https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine/blob/master/dist/images/example1_placemark_export.PNG?raw=true)  \r\n_**Figure 4.** Click the export button to export to .kml._\r\n\r\n7. Open your newly exported **aroundtheblock_basicplacemark.kml** file by double clicking it (you must have Google Earth installed). It will launch in Google Earth (Figure 5). You'll notice that this track is a walk around the block in Philadelphia, PA, and that the placemarks are blue and have white labels. Click on the placemarks to see what time the placemark occured.\r\n\r\n![Figure 5](https://github.com/EdFarrell/MilkMachine/blob/master/dist/images/example1_placemark_GE.PNG?raw=true)  \r\n_**Figure 5.** Check out your .kml file in Google Earth._\r\n\r\n## Example 2: Create a .kml tour\r\ncoming soon\r\n## Example 3: Sync an audio file to your tour\r\ncoming soon\r\n# Roadmap\r\ncoming soon\r\n\r\n# Authors, Contributors, Support\r\n- The code was developed by Ed Farrell (@EdFarrell) & Sean McGinnis (@SeanKMcGinnis), and is maintained by Ed. \r\n- MilkMachine was developed to support the 250 Miles Crossing Philadelphia Project (http://www.250miles.net/), featuring digital artists Esther Polak and Ivar van Bekkum (http://www.polakvanbekkum.com/).\r\n- Support for the project came from these sources:\r\n  * University City Science Center\r\n  * Wexford Science + Technology\r\n  * Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority \r\n  * Drexel University","google":"UA-68990484-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
